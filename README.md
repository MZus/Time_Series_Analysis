# Time_Series_Analysis
This R Notebook performs a full time series analysis of Ferrari’s daily closing stock prices from April 17, 2023 to April 17, 2024. It includes data setup, stationarity testing using the KPSS test, differencing, ACF and PACF visualization, ARIMA model fitting, residual diagnostics, and forecast generation. The analysis compares a manually specified ARIMA(0,1,10) model with an automatically selected ARIMA model to evaluate predictive performance and model adequacy.
